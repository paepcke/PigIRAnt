/**
 * Starting with an index built by, for example, buildWebBaseIndex,
 * generate a word distance file. For example, starting with
 * an index for these two documents:
 * 
 * Doc1:
 *    This man lives in the sun.
 *    My wife lives near the train station.
 *
 * Doc2:
 *    Girl child lives close.
 *    Wife near me lives station of train.
 *
 * the partial index would look like this:
 * 
 * Input : ({(man,d1,0),(lives,d1,1),(sun,d1,2)})
 * 
 * and this word distances script would output:
 *    (man,lives,1,d1)
 *    (man,sun,2,d1)
 *    (lives,sun,1,d1)
 *
 * Similarly:
 *    
 * Input: ({(Girl,d2,0),(child,d2,1),(lives,d2,2),(close,d2,3)})
 * would generate:
 *  (girl,child,1,d2
 *	(child,lives,1,d2
 *	(girl,lives,2,d2
 *	(lives,close,1,d2
 *	(child,close,2,d2
 *	(girl,close,3,d2)
 *
 * Notice that 'Girl' is lower-case in the output. This
 *        is true for all entries.
 *        
 * The maximum distance between words that will still output
 * these distance tuples is set in the UDF MakeWordPairDistances.java.
 * Default is a distance of 5 (inclusive).
 *
 * All of the following assumed parameters are set by 
 * the script makeWordPairDistances (in collaboration with
 * the companion script pigrun):
  
 *   $INDEX_FILE is set to the absolute HDFS path of the
 *                index file from which the distances are
 *                to be computed.
 *   $WORD_DISTS_DEST is the full path for the destination
 *                file.
 *    $SORT0, $SORT1,...,$SORT7  see below
 *    
 *   $PIG_HOME points to root of Pig installation
 *   $USER_CONTRIB points to location of PigIR.jar
 *   $USER_CONTRIB points to location of jsoup-1.5.2.jar
